[Verse 1]
Lying on a fake beach, you'll never get a tan (A tan, a tan, tan)
Baby, I'm gonna leave you drowning
Until you reach for my hand (My hand, my hand, my hand)

[Pre-Chorus]
In the night, your heart is full
And by the morning, empty
(In love, in love, oh-oh-oh)
But, baby, I'm the one who left you
You're not the one who left me
(In love, in love, oh-oh-oh-oh)

[Chorus 1]
When you're around me, I'm radioactive
My blood is burning, radioactive
I'm turning radioactive
My blood is radioactive
My heart is nuclear
Love is all that I fear
I'm turning radioactive
My blood is radioactive

[Verse 2]
Waiting for the nightfall
For my heart to light up
Oh, baby, I want you to die for
For you to die for my love (My love, my love, my love)

[Pre-Chorus]
In the night, your heart is full
And by the morning, empty
(In love, in love, oh-oh-oh)
But, baby, I'm the one who left you
You're not the one who left me
(In love, in love, oh-oh-oh-oh)

[Chorus 2]
When you're around me, I'm radioactive
My blood is burning, radioactive
I'm turning radioactive
My blood is radioactive
My heart is nuclear
Love is all that I fear
Ready to be let down
And now, Iâ€™m heading for a meltdown

[Bridge]
Tonight, I feel like neon gold
I take one look at you and I grow cold
And I grow cold
And I grow cold

[Chorus 2]
When you're around me, I'm radioactive
My blood is burning, radioactive
I'm turning radioactive
My blood is radioactive
My heart is nuclear
Love is all that I fear
Ready to be let down
And now, I'm heading for a meltdown

[Outro]
My heart is nuclear
Love is all that I fear
